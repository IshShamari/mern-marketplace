# WIP
This project is still in a work in progress state
# mern-marketplace
Monorepository to showcase my ability with MERN and Azure services.

# Overview:
Develop a simple e-commerce marketplace where sellers can list products and buyers can purchase them. This marketplace will demonstrate a distributed microservices architecture using the MERN stack. Each service, such as User Management, Product Management, and Order Management, will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes.

# Key Components:
1. **User Management**: CRUD operations for users (signup, login, edit profile, etc.).
2. **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products (add, edit, delete, view).
3. **Order Management**: CRUD operations for orders (create orders, view orders, edit order status).

# Key Features:
1. **Frontend**: A React-based frontend for the marketplace.
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express-based microservices.
3. **Database**: MongoDB as the data store.
